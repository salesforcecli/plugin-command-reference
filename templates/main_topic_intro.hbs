        <note>We provide the commands in the <codeph otherprops="nolang">{{topic}}</codeph> topic to selected customers through an invitation-only
            pilot program that requires agreement to specific terms and conditions. Pilot programs are subject to change, and we can’t
            guarantee acceptance. The commands in the <codeph otherprops="nolang">{{topic}}</codeph> topic aren’t generally available unless or
            until Salesforce announces its general availability in documentation or in press
            releases or public statements. We can’t guarantee general availability within any
            particular time frame or at all. Make your purchase decisions only on the basis of
            generally available products and features.</note>
